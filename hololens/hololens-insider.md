## Start receiving Insider builds

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven’t updated recently, please reboot your device to update state and get the latest build.
>
> - The “Reboot device” voice command works well.
> - You can also choose the restart button in Settings/Windows Insider Program.
>
> We had a bug on the back-end that you may have encountered and this will get you back on track.

On a HoloLens 2 device go to **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program** and select **Get started**. Link the account you used to register as a Windows Insider.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to enroll your device in Insider builds, you'll need to enable optional telemetry. If you have not done this already, open the Settings app and select **Privacy** -> **Diagnostics & feedback** and then select **Optional diagnostics data**.

Windows insider is now moving to Channels. The **Fast** ring will become the **Dev Channel**, the **Slow** ring will become the **Beta Channel**, and the **Release Preview** ring will become the **Release Preview Channel**. Here is what that mapping looks like:
